		<p>Anchor comes shipped with a lightweight administration area to power your site, and is located at <code>yoursite.com/admin</code> (where yoursite.com is your site, of course).</p>

		<h3>Accessing the admin panel</h3>
		<p>By default, the administrator&rsquo;s details are as follows:</p>

		<dl class="grid">
		    <dt>Username:</dt>
		        <dd>admin</dd>
		    <dt>Password:</dt>
		        <dd><em>A unique password will be generated for you.</em></dd>
		</dl>

		<p><strong>In order to keep your site secure, it is vitally important you change these immediately.</strong>

		<h3>The panel</h3>

		<p>When you log in to Anchor, you&rsquo;ll be greeted with something that looks a bit like this. This is the main administration area, and it&rsquo;s been designed to be super-easy to use.</p>

		<p>To edit a blog entry, just click the title; to add a blog entry, just click the "Create a new post" button. The same follows for users and pages, and you&rsquo;ll pick it up within minutes.</p>
