		<h2>Theming Anchor</h2>

		<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used WordPress, or written a PHP script before,
		you&rsquo;ll be familiar with Anchor&rsquo;s function-based theming
		system. If not, it&rsquo;s still very easy to pick up, and you can make
		your own theme in less than an hour!</p>

		<h3>Creating your first theme</h3>

		<p>Anchor ships with a default theme a invaluable resource towards building
		your own theme, and it is recommended you duplicate one as a base for your
		theme.</p>

		<p>There are a number of <a href="/docs/files">required and optional files</a>
		in a theme, and there is a comprehensive list of the
		<a href="/docs/functions">available functions</a> within Anchor. All that&rsquo;s
		left is some creativity and time, and you&rsquo;ll be on your way to making a
		perfect custom theme for your blog.</p>
