				<div>
					<i class="sprite markdown"></i>

					<h1>Works with Markdown.</h1>
					<p>When it comes to writing blogs, nothing can beat Markdown, the simple and elegant markup language for prose. Anchor supports it out the box in posts and pages.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<i class="sprite rss"></i>

					<h1>Really simple RSS.</h1>
					<p>If you want RSS on your Anchor blog, there’s no need for plugins; all you have to do is add <code>/feed</code> to the URL.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<i class="sprite drafts"></i>

					<h1>Delayed, drafted and done.</h1>
					<p>You can write as many private posts as you want. No-one ever needs to see them until you hit <em>“Publish”</em>.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<i class="sprite plugins"></i>

					<h1>Power-ups and plug-ins. <span class="badge">New</span></h1>
					<p>With version 1.0, Anchor has a plugin architecture built in to the core which allows infinite extending possibilities.</p>
					<p>We’re talking Stretch Armstrong-level cool here. It’s pretty dang cool. Anyway, uh, you can get plugins from the <a href="//anchorplugins.com">Anchor Plugins</a> website.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<i class="sprite plugins"></i>

					<i class="sprite stopwatch"><span class="dial"></span></i>

					<h1>It’s really fast.</h1>
					<p>A typical Anchor page, with all the bells and whistles turned on, takes about 15ms to render.</p>
					<p>That’s roughly 66 pages per second.</p>
					<p>It’s not just fast loading either: from downloaded to installed takes about a minute as well.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<i class="sprite extend"></i>

					<h1>It’s tweakable and tunable.</h1>
					<p>As nice as Anchor is out the box, there’s extra functionality and themes you can’t get without some extra help. Luckily, there’s a <a href="//anchorthemes.com">theme</a> and <a href="//anchorplugins.com">plugin</a> system built-in.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<i class="sprite seo"></i>

					<h1>It’s <abbr title="Google">search-engine</abbr> friendly.</h1>
					<p>If a blogger posts on their site and no-one is there to read it, does the post exist?</p>
					<p>Luckily, with Anchor, you’ll never need to know. We automatically populate your site with all the relevant metadata to get picked up by all the big search engines.</p>
