				<h1>It’s really fast. <em title="¡Andale! ¡Andale! ¡Arriba! ¡Arriba! ¡Yii-hah!">Speedy Gonzales</em>—fast.</h1>
				<p>A typical Anchor page, with all the bells and whistles turned on — takes about 15ms to render. That’s about 66 pages per second. It’s not just fast loading either: from downloaded to installed takes about a minute as well.</p>

				<h1>It’s tweakable and tunable.</h1>
				<p>As nice as Anchor is out the box, there’s extra functionality and themes you can’t get without some extra help. Luckily, there’s a <a href="//anchorthemes.com">theme</a> and <a href="//anchorplugins.com">plugin</a> system built-in.</p>

				<h1>It’s <abbr title="Google">search-engine</abbr> friendly.</h1>
				<p>If a blogger posts on their site and no-one is there to read it, does the post exist? Luckily, with Anchor, you’ll never need to know. We automatically populate your site with all the relevant metadata to get picked up by all the big search engines.</p>

				<h1>It’ll work on pretty much <em>anything</em>.</h1>
				<p>All your web server needs is a database and PHP, which 99% of web-hosts have. Apart from that, Anchor works on the fastest of computers, the smallest smartphones and everything in between.</p>
